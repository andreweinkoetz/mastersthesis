\label{ch:CaseStudyEvaluation}

Evaluating our proposed system demonstrates its usefulness in a potential target environment. For the concrete instantiation, the Swift programming language was selected to implement custom subsystems. Required functionality that was already available is integrated using third-party Swift packages. All used packages are published under MIT license. Since it is a prototypical implementation, it supports importing IDLs only for REST-based Web APIs that are described using the OpenAPI specification. Furthermore, its support for generating client libraries is limited to the Swift programming language.
