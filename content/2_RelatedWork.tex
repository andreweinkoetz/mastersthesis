Our work relates to current research of API evolution, which focusses on classification and patterns for Web API changes. Studies were also conducted to analyze thei impact on client applications for both local libraries and Web APIs. Furthermore, research has been devoted to automating migration of breaking changes in client code for evolving local libraries. Based on insights from previous work and considering the challenges associated with Web API evolution, our research concentrates on reducing the impact of breaking changes in Web APIs on consuming applications by automating the migration process for client developers.
