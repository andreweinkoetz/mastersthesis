\section{Conclusion}

\textit{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Describe honestly the achieved goals (e.g., the well implemented and tested use cases) and the open goals here.
        \item If you only have achieved goals, you did something wrong in your analysis.
    \end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Realized Goals}

\textit{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Summarize the achieved goals by repeating the realized requirements or use cases stating how you realized them.
    \end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Open Goals}

\textit{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Summarize the open goals by repeating the open requirements or use cases and explaining why you were not able to achieve them.
        \item It might be suspicious if you do not have open goals, this usually indicates that you did not thoroughly analyze your problems.
    \end{itemize}
