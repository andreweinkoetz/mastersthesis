After the initial introduction into challenges of Web API evolution and our motivation to overcome them in chapter \ref{ch:Introduction}, we examine the current state of related research topics in chapter \ref{ch:RelatedWork}. Identifying the challenges in related research faciliates defining the key requirements for our proposed workflow and discovers several limitations to be aware of as Web APIs evolve. Chapter \ref{ch:RequirementsElicitation} comprises all requirements and constraints we identified from related work. In addition, we were able to derive multiple use cases from potential real-world scenarios.
